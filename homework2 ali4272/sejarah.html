          Borobudur Temple was built by Mahayana Buddhists during the heyday of the Syailendra Dynasty. Borobudur was first built on the initiative of King Samaratungga around 824 AD. Even so, Borobudur Temple was completed near 900 AD during the reign of Queen Pramudawardhani, daughter of King Samaratungga. The architect who was instrumental in designing the temple was Gunadharma.

          Reportedly, the splendor of Borobudur was lost for centuries buried in soil and volcanic ash which is thought to be the effect of the eruption of Mount Merapi. However, the temple was successfully restored by the government of Thomas Stamford Raffles when he served as Governor General on the island of Java in 1911.
